## Covering Note

Decided to use typescript. When dealing with a lot of data I find the development and maintanence of code to be much easier when a type checking library is used.
Time constraints meant I wasn't able to carry out the additional tasks; creating a frontend to display the data. I have quite a few front end skills which I would have wanted to display such as SASS & React.js.

To run app Node is required. When is app/ directory, running 

        npm i
	npm run build
        npm run start

should start the TCP server using the Node module Net. This recieves the packets and saves them to the mongoDb running in the docker container
